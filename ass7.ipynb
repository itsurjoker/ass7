    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). It refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features or functionalities to the outside world. In simpler terms, abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
